            The data from this project was taken from Kaggle's 
            <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview">Toxic Comment Classification Challenge</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this dataset, 159,571 Wikipedia comments were labeled by human raters for toxic behavior and split into the following non-exclusive categories:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-group" style = "width: 100%;">
            <li class="list-group-item">toxic</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">severe_toxic</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">obscene</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">threat</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">insult</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">identity_hate</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          <br>
           To be consistent with the definiton of "Hate Speech", a single cetegory was created from severe_toxic and identity_hate.
           <br>
           Comments that were only toxic, obscene, threat, or insult were treated as neutral, non-flagged speech.
